2012.07.*, Version v0.1.3

* Bug fixed: lastReaded file not always was realy last.
Because of asynchronous nature of node, there is no 
sence to pass the lastReadedFile boolean parameter,
because we can not exactly say when file would be readed.

* Fixed bug with no dependencies installed, now code
doesn't changing, just saves the copy of it in min dir.

now all.min.css writes all the time, even not minimized
and whith no converted to base64 images, but still containing
all css files.
